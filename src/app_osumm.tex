\chapter{Summary of O star results and spectra}
\label{app:osumm}

This appendix summarises the adopted parameters and shows fit-diagrams
and model fits for each WHT/UES star derived in chapter
\ref{ch:analyses}. The results for each star are shown on two pages,
the first page lists the adopted parameters and shows the fit diagrams
in two columns. The left-hand column shows the diagrams for a
microturbulent velocity, $\xi = 0$~\kms, and the right-hand column for
$\xi = 15$~\kms. Three values of the helium number fraction, $y =
0.09$, 0.12 and 0.15 are shown, with $y$ increasing downwards. The
`best-fit' diagram for each star is shown at the end of chapter
\ref{ch:analyses}.

The second page for each star shows comparisons of model spectra and
observations for the lines used in the analyses. Also included
are selected wavelength regions, including \lam\lam4000--4200\AA\
which includes many of the lines used in the analyses,
\lam\lam4400--4600\AA\ which includes the strong \hei\ \lam4471\AA\
line, the \heii\ \lam4541\AA\ line, several lines of C, N and O, and
the diffuse interstellar band at \lam4430\AA. Also sometimes visible
are the unidentified emission lines at $\lambda\lambda$4465 and
4505\AA. The \lam\lam4600--4700\AA\ region contains a wealth of C, N
and O lines which often reveal carbon and nitrogen abundance anomalies
(cf. appendix \ref{app:ocn}), and the strong \heii\ \lam4686\AA\ line which is
very sensitive to stellar wind and mass loss. Finally the plots also
include \ha. Line identifications are from
\ybcite{scholtz:lines}.
