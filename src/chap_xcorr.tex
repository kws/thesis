\chapter{A survey of rotational velocities}
\label{ch:xcorr}

There is a small mystery about the rotational properties of
early-type stars. The apparent deficit of narrow-lined O stars
suggests that some type of `turbulence' might be contributing to the
overall line broadening (e.g. \cite{co:vii}). The exact nature of this
turbulence is unknown, although it appears that it is more important in
evolved stars (\cite{pe:xcorr}; \cite{ho:xcorr} and chapters
\ref{ch:casestudy} to \ref{ch:odiscuss} in this thesis).

Recent evolutionary models show that rotation is important not only
for the stars' physical properties, in terms of temperature and
luminosity, but also for the surface element abundances (\cite{la:98};
\cite{ma:98}; \cite{me:98}). This could help solve many discrepancies
between observations and evolutionary models (e.g. the \emph{mass
discrepancy} discussed in section
\ref{sec:mass_discrepancy}) and the chemical anomalies seen in the
OBC/OBN stars (section \ref{sec:cno_anomalies}). A better
understanding of the rotational properties of early-type stars would
indicate if rotation is important in the evolution of most
OB-stars.

Rotation has also been connected with several types of variability in
early-type stars. Rapidly rotating OB stars appear to be particularly
prone to absorption-line variability (\cite{fu:96}) and rotation is
expected to be related to the emission mechanism in Be stars (see
section \ref{sec:intro:be}).

A cross-correlation analysis of line widths in O and supergiant B
stars was performed by \ybcite{ho:xcorr}. The cross-correlation
routines developed for that project have since been automated to the
point where large scale surveys are possible. To test the routines,
and expand the sample from
\acite{ho:xcorr}, we measured a large sample of B stars of all
luminosity classes.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%% SAMPLE
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The sample}

To obtain an unbiased sample of stars, all the B stars from the Bright
Star Catalogue (\cite{bsc5}) were cross-checked with the IUE observing
logs. Usually, the newest observations of a given star were used,
unless these were noted to be of poor quality or to have a low number
of peak counts. Because we initially did not have access to the
complete IUE logs, some stars were observed more recently than we were
first aware of. In these cases, we have also tried to include analyses of
the new observations. Also, when the quality of the observations was
questionable, several spectra were analysed. Some stars from
\ybcite{ho:xcorr} were included to test the accuracy of the automatic
measurements. 

Little or no care was taken to exclude peculiar or non-related objects
(e.g. mis-identified stars in the observing logs or stars with
erroneous spectral types in the Bright Star Catalogue) from the
analysis. We expect some of these objects to reveal themselves
subsequently by failing to give a strong cross-correlation peak with
the template stars used.

Since Bright Star Catalogue (hereafter BSC) spectral types are
sometimes inaccurate and are usually of uncertain provenance, better
documented spectral types were adopted from 
the references listed in appendix \ref{app:xcorr}. The data were
reduced as explained in chapter \ref{ch:obs}, using essentially the
same routines as those described in \ybcite{ho:winds}.

\section{Cross-correlation analysis}
\label{sec:xcorr:analysis}

The analyses were performed by using a C-shell wrapper for \dipso. The
wrapper script would launch \dipso, select an appropriate template and
mask (see below), perform the cross-correlation, gaussian fitting,
and then extract the fit-data and the cross-correlation functions
(CCFs) for future reference. All the information was stored in a
machine readable format%
%
\footnote{The cross-correlation script would
itself create another script for each star with the analysis results
in it. Thus all that is required to access the data is to `source'
this data-script. A relatively slow and arguably inefficient, but very
flexible and easy to use, way of storing data.}
%
to simplify the statistical analysis.

The cross-correlation was performed by first masking out P~Cygni
profiles, very strong photospheric lines (dependent on spectral type), and
interstellar lines in the target and template spectra. The very
strong photospheric lines will dominate the cross-correlation function
and may be significantly Stark broadened in addition to being
rotationally broadened; any irregular effects in these lines will
dilute the influence of the many weaker lines. More reliable results
are obtained by masking out these lines.

Next, the spectra were normalised to a zero-level continuum by
dividing by polynomial fits and subtracting unity. The masked out
regions were then filled with zeros to make sure they would not give
false correlations, and finally the spectra were cross-correlated.

The cross-correlation functions (CCFs) could then be measured. This is
slightly complicated by random correlations (which will always occur)
giving `background noise'. This causes the CCF peak to sit on top of a
`shoulder' caused by these random correlations (which are dependent on
the template used).  To simplify the measurements of the CCFs this
shoulder was removed by fitting a polynomial to the CCF (see figure
\ref{fig:xcorr:example})%
%
\footnote{Including the cross-correlation
functions for all the analysed stars would unfortunately take up far
too much space to be included in the printed version of this thesis,
but they are available in HTML format on the attached CD-ROM (see
appendix \ref{app:cdrom}).}
%
in the regions with a velocity-shift of more than $\pm500$~\kms. This
`flattens' most of the CCF caused by random correlations but
still leaves the peak. The cross-correlation functions were then fitted
with gaussians (by the \dipso\ subroutine \elf) using a least-squares
fitting method in order to obtain the widths and strengths
(the latter represented by the peak intensity and integrated area of the CCF).

}
\label{fig:xcorr:example}
\end{figure}   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Every star was cross-correlated against four different template
spectra, as listed in table \ref{ta:templates}, to ensure that at
least one strong CCF was obtained across the entire spectral range
investigated. Although it is more 
customary to use the area to represent the strength of a CCF, the CCF
with the strongest peak intensity was picked as the one best
representing the star. Since all the template stars are narrow-lined,
there should be very small width variations when a single star is
cross-correlated against the four templates. However, the polynomial
flattening of the CCF discussed above is not perfect, and can
sometimes leave a significant bump around the base of the CCF
peak. This bump can `fool' the gaussian fitting routines into using a
much broader function. This will increase the area of the function
but leave the peak intensity relatively unchanged.

In this preliminary, automated run of the routines, no other quality
control was performed (apart from visual inspection to check for
obvious binaries). However work is underway to develop automatic
detection of possible double lined spectroscopic binaries, and a
measure of the `goodness-of-fit' of the gaussians.

%%%%%%%%%%% CALIBRATIONS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Calibration}
\label{sec:xcorr:cal}

This chapter is titled a survey of rotational velocities; however,
what we measure is the line width and not the rotational
velocity. This chapter is based on the assumption that these two
parameters are the same, although as seen in \ybcite{pe:xcorr},
\ybcite{ho:xcorr} and also chapters
\ref{ch:casestudy}--\ref{ch:odiscuss} in this thesis, this assumption
is probably not correct. There is now extensive evidence to suggest
that rotation is not the only process contributing to absorption-line
broadening in early type stars. We will, however, still work on the
assumption that the quantity \vsini\ is closely related to the true
projected equatorial rotation velocity.

The usual way of determining rotational velocities
(e.g. \cite{sl:75} and \cite{co:vii}) is by comparing observations
with rotationally broadened synthetic spectra. Unfortunately models
are not yet up to accurately reproducing the line-blanketed UV spectra of
hot stars, and we need a different approach of constructing a FWHM to
\vsini\ calibration. As shown in \ybcite{ho:xcorr}, reliable
calibrations can be found by creating artificially `spun up' versions
of the template spectra (created by convolving the template spectra
with the rotational broadening function given by \cite{gray}) and
measuring these in the same way as for the sample stars. These
calibrations are shown in figures \ref{fig:xcorr:fwhm} and
\ref{fig:xcorr:cal} together with a comparisons of CCF peak widths
(FWHM) and velocities measured using different templates.

There appear to be some systematic differences between measured
widths (and derived velocities) found using different templates. This
is almost certainly caused by the CCF background correlations
discussed in section \ref{sec:xcorr:analysis}. Although the actual
width of the CCF peak should not change, the gaussian fits might be
slightly different. Since the background correlations are dependent on the
spectral type of the template used (and also on the spectral type of
the target star, but since we only usually consider stars that are
within a couple of subtypes of the template it is relatively
unaffected by the target star) the effect is fairly systematic and can
be corrected for.

We thus want to `force' all the templates to follow the same velocity
scale. One way to do this would be to quantify the differences in measured widths
found by using the different templates. However, since the background
CCF `shoulder' also appears to be a function of velocity (as can be
seen by the variations in FWHM--\vsini\ calibrations for the different
templates), the correction would also have to be a function of velocity.

It appears, though, that after applying the ``raw'' velocity calibrations
(which remove the principal dependence on velocity) the problem reduces to an
approximately linear relation. We fit (by least-squares) straight lines of the
form $y = bx$ to the plots as shown in figure \ref{fig:xcorr:cal}. This gives
us (from the gradients) the typical ratios between
measured velocities found from the different templates. If we assume
that the smallest and largest velocities are off by approximately the
same factors we can adopt the `best' velocity as the geometric mean of the
`typical' velocities:
\begin{equation*}
v_\mathrm{best} = \sqrt[4]{v_\tau \times v_\iota \times v_\pi \times v_\alpha}
\end{equation*}
where $v_\tau$, $v_\iota$, $v_\pi$, $v_\alpha$ are the velocities
found by using the \tausco, \iother, \picet\ and \alplyr\ templates
respectively. For any given star, we only need to have measured one of
these velocities, which can then be corrected to the common
scale. Table \ref{ta:xcorr:funcs} lists the velocity corrections
applied to bring the velocities to the common scale, and figure
\ref{fig:xcorr:cor} shows the plots of measured velocities after
applying the velocity corrections and the `corrected' FWHM--\vsini\
calibrations.

So, just to summarise briefly, the steps involved in finding the
adopted velocities are:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item	Convert FWHM to \vsini\ using `theoretical' calibration for
	each template
\item	Find template-to-template differences
\item	Apply linear correction
\end{itemize}
%
If more than one spectrum for any given star is measured, we adopt the
median of the corrected velocities for each spectrum.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%% PREVIOUS WORK
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Comparison with previous work}

Using the FWHM -- \vsini\ calibrations discussed above we can now
derive values of \vsini\ for each star. The corrected velocities for
each star and template are listed in appendix \ref{app:xcorr}. The
table there also lists the adopted velocity, which is the velocity
obtained from the `strongest' cross-correlation function. Where more
than one spectrum for a given star has been analysed, the adopted
velocity is the mean of the velocities from the strongest CCFs.

Since our approach is fully automatic, and because the decision of
what is the ``best'' \vsini\ was ad hoc, it is important to compare it
to previous measurements to see if there are any systematic
differences. Figure \ref{fig:idhcomp} shows the values derived in this
thesis compared to those published in \ybcite{ho:xcorr} (these values
are also presented in table \ref{ta:xcorr:idh}). Indeed there does
appear to be some systematic differences. Plotting the ratio of the
MNRAS results to the new values (lower panel) it appears that the the
current \tausco\ velocities come out slightly higher than before, and
the \iother\ results are lower. This is exactly what is expected
taking into consideration the new velocity corrections applied to each
template's measured velocities. Also shown on the figure are the
velocities for
\tausco\ and \iother, and it appears that the measured velocities
scatter evenly around these lines, with a couple of exceptions.

velocity corrections applied to the \tausco\ and \iother\ velocities respectively.}

The most notable of these exceptions is HD~75759. Looking at the CCF
for this star, it appears to have a double peak (see figure
\ref{fig:ccf:hd75759}). This star is listed as a double-lined
spectroscopic binary in \ybcite{mason:98}. In the case of the other
discrepant star, HD~219188, it is not so clear why the results are in
disagreement. The CCF for this star is single-peaked, although it
appears to be weak and slightly irregular in shape (figure
\ref{fig:ccf:hd219188}). The spectrum appears very noisy, and it could
be the case of a low S/N exposure or problems during data reduction.

The comparison above only covers the early-type B supergiants (and a
couple of O stars) since these were the only stars covered in
\acite{ho:xcorr} To investigate the full range of spectral types
covered, we compare with the list of standard velocity stars by
\acite{sl:75} (figure
\ref{fig:sletcomp}). Here the velocities are in good agreement. The
rms dispersion about the mean offset is only 11.3~\kms (9 per cent of
the cross-correlation velocities).%
%
% Found from the awk scrip 0average.awk in fig_xcorr/slettebak/

These values exclude the only star for which the velocity estimates
are in clear disagreement. \acite{sl:75} found a velocity of 400~kms
for HD~142983 (48~Lib), whereas the cross-correlation analysis
suggests a relatively narrow-lined star with a velocity of only about
40~\kms\ (see figure \ref{fig:ccf:hd142983}). 48~Lib is a well known
shell star (e.g. \cite{un:48lib}) and the narrow cross-correlation
function is probably from correlations with the narrow shell
absorption lines present in the UV spectrum of this star
(e.g. \cite{1981A&A...100...79R}) rather than from photospheric lines.

\section{Discussion}

Figure \ref{fig:veldist} show velocity distributions for the B
stars. It is fairly clear from the diagrams that there are very
different distributions of velocities for main-sequence stars
(luminosity classes IV and V) and supergiants (I and II), and also
that there appears to be some difference between the early-type
supergiants and late-type supergiants. The lower panel in this figure
shows the velocity distributions for the stars grouped by their BSC
catalogue spectral types, while the stars in the top panel have
spectral types from the references listed in appendix
\ref{app:xcorr} (most of these stars also have BSC spectral
types).

\subsection{Supergiant velocity distributions}

Comparing the cumulative distributions with those in \acite{ho:xcorr},
it appears there is a sequence of increasing \vsini\ with spectral
type for the supergiants. In fact, extending table 4 from
\acite{ho:xcorr} (table \ref{ta:vsini:median}) we see the median
velocities for each spectral subtype slowly increase from about 40~\kms\
at B9.5 to approximately 90~\kms\ at B0 and further to more than 100~\kms\ for
the early O-stars. Similarly the lowest \vsini\ in each group also
seems to increase uniformly with spectral type. The only exceptions to
this are HD~202124 (B0~II) with a \vsini~=~38~\kms and HD~44743
(B1~II-III; \vsini~=~38~\kms). The second slowest rotators in the same
group as each of these stars have rotational velocities of 72 and
55~\kms respectively. This is in good agreement with \ybcite{co:vii}
who suggest that the observed line broadening in O stars is caused
both by rotation and by some other broadening factor (some sort of
`turbulence') which might contribute to the broadening with about
50~\kms\ for a late O-star and even more for earlier types. It appears
that this effect is less important for the B stars, and trails off
towards the late-Bs.

\subsection{Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test}
\label{sec:ks}

The Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (or K-S) test allows us to compare two
data sets and find the statistical probability that they are drawn
from the same distribution. The test works by finding the maximum
distance between two cumulative probability distributions (like our
velocity distributions):
\begin{equation*}
D = \underset{-\infty < x < \infty}{\mathrm{max}} |S_{N_1}(x) -
S_{N_2}(x)|
\end{equation*}
where $S_{N_1}(x)$ and $S_{N_2}(x)$ are the respective cumulative
distribution functions to be compared. See Numerical Recipes
(\cite{nr}) for a more general discussion about the K-S test and how
to find the probability $P$ that the two data sets are drawn from the
same distribution.

We can use the K-S test, first to check if our two sources of spectral
types can be used to split the complete sample into subgroups which
are in good agreement. Table \ref{ta:ks:spectypes} compare samples of
stars, grouped by their individually references spectral types, or the
BSC spectral types (figure \ref{fig:veldist}). Although there are
differences between the two samples, each of the subgroups%
%
\footnote{The stellar sample was divided into early-type (earlier than
B5) and late-type (later than B5 inclusive) stars. These were then
divided into supergiants (SG; luminosity classes I and II) and
main-sequence (MS; luminosity classes III--V) stars.}
%
does appear to be drawn from the
same distributions.

Next we want to see how the subgroups compare with each other (table
\ref{ta:ks:inter}). The only groups that appear to be at all similar
are the early and late type main-sequence stars (although at a very
low probability; but see section \ref{sec:ms_vdist}). The two
supergiant groups vary significantly in their distributions, and it is
unlikely that these are part of a common distribution of rotational

\subsection{Main-sequence velocity distributions and Be stars}
\label{sec:ms_vdist}

The main-sequence distributions (figures \ref{fig:veldist} and
\ref{fig:veldist_gr}) show a much larger spread in velocities than
the supergiants.
The distribution for all luminosity class IV and V objects, including
Be stars (figure \ref{fig:veldist}) shows an almost linear cumulative
distribution, meaning there is an almost identical number of stars at
all velocities up to a maximum of just above 300~\kms. However,
plotting the Be stars separately (figure \ref{fig:veldist_gr}), there
appears to be a significantly different distribution of velocities for
the two groups, with the Be stars appearing to belong to a group with
high rotational velocities, peaking at about 250~\kms. This fits in
well with the theories that the emission mechanism in Be stars is
somehow connected to rotation, e.g. through the formation of a
`disk'-like dense wind around the equator (see section \ref{sec:intro:be}).

The trend of increasing \vsini\ with spectral type, seen for the
supergiants, is not evident for the main-sequence stars. Although there
do appear to be some differences between the different groups
(because of the larger sample of main-sequence stars, split
into four groups in figure \ref{fig:veldist_gr}), there do not
appear to be any clear trends. The group containing stars of spectral
types B2--B3 appears to rotate slightly slower than the other stars,
and the latest-type stars (B7--B9) appear to be rotating slightly
faster. However, it is probably more likely that these represent the
extremes of a random distribution of errors in the measurements. Even
small errors in the measurements are quite visible when plotted as a
cumulative distribution, since they tend to shift the entire
distribution one way or the other. Applying the K-S test to these
datasets, we get a probability of one that groups 1 and 3 (B0--B1.5
and B4--B6) are drawn from the same distribution, and a probability of
0.1 that group 1 or 3 is drawn from the same distributions as both
group 2 and 4 (B2--B3 and B7--B9). This probably means that they all
belong to the same distribution.

{\fcfont Main-sequence and Be velocity distributions. Top figure shows
velocity distributions for main-sequence (luminosity classes V and IV)
B subtypes as indicated (not including Be). Lower figure compares all
the `normal' main-sequence stars to main-sequence Be stars. The Be
stars clearly belong to a group that is, on average, rotating
faster. Note that the figures show the normalised distributions and
there that are far more stars in the group not showing emission.
